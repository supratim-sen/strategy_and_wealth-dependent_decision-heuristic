N = 17, Runs = 1000, re = 0.3, $\lambda$ = 0.001, $p_0$ values chosen from Nishi et al (Nature 2015) paper. Initial GINI = 0,0.2 and 0.4 for None, Low, High respectively. 

The codes generates figures that uses two different decision heuristics for both visible and invisible wealth scenarios.
1. A standard decision heuristic described by eq.2&3 in the paper that reproduces the experimental observations in Nishi et al. (Nature 2015) 
2. An inverted decision heuristic described and discussed in the Discussion section of the paper.
